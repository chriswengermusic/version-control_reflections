What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The initialization process attaches the .git file to the repository, allowing git to do its
magic. Without this important element, there is no place for git to store the metadata that
tracks changes and versions of all the files in the repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is what's actively changing, or at least able to be changed. The staging
area is a "pre-archive" of sorts: not yet tucked away, but almost safe from unintentional edits.
The staging area offers the ability to compare and make sure you're doing what you want to be
doing, when you want to be doing it. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

With the ability to utilize git diff (no arguments), I can easily contrast the working directory
with the staging area, double checking the changes I'm committing. This allows me to ensure that
the difference between working directory and staging area, as well as staging area to commit1
are logical changes, and incremental as I intend them to be.
