When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Obviously, anytime I want to share my work with others, this is the most convenient means
to accomplish that.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If someone else is collaborating with me via GitHub and changes something and makes a commit,
I want the opportunity to review, accept and commit those changes before they are merged into 
my master or other branch. If git and GitHub automatically synced, I wouldn't have this ability.
